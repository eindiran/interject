interject \- Inspect and edit the contents of a pipe
.SH SYNOPSIS
command1 | interject [-s] [-e EDITOR] [-t TEMPDIR] | command2
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B interject(1)
is a tool for inspecting the contents of a pipe with an editor.
This is particularly useful in the case where you plan on piping a script retrieved by

into a shell directly.
.B interject(1)
is an alternative to
.BR vipe(1)
that allows the user to control the tool with flags, in addition to environment variables.

.B EDITOR
If the
.B \-e
option is not used,

will use the editor set in this environment variable.
If the variable is unset,

will default to using
.BR vim(1)
.PP
.TP
.B TEMPDIR
If the
.B \-t
option is not  used,

will use a temporary directory set in this environment variable.
